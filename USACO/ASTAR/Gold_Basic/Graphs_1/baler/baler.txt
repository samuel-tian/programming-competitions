The Loathesome Hay Baler
========================

Farmer John has purchased the world's most loathesome hay baler.
Instead of having a driver roller that drives maybe an idler roller
that drives the power take-off for the baler, it has N rollers (2
<= N <= 1050) which drive and are driven by various rollers.

FJ has meticulously cataloged data for each roller i: X_i,Y_i are
the center of the roller (-5000 <= X_i <= 5000; -5000 <= Y_i <=
5000); R_i is the roller's radius (3 <= R_i <= 800). The drive
roller is located at 0,0; the baler power take-off is located at
X_t,Y_t (numbers supplied in the input).

The drive roller turns clockwise at 10,000 revolutions per hour.
Your job is to determine the speeds of all the rollers that are in
the power-train: from the drive roller through the power take-off
roller. Rollers that do not transfer power to the take-off roller
are to be ignored. A roller of radius Rd that is turning at S rph
and driving another roller of radius Rx will cause the second roller
to turn at the speed -S*Rd/Rx (where the sign denotes whether the
roller is turning clockwise or counterclockwise (anticlockwise for
our British friends)).

Determine the power-train path and report the sum of the absolute
values of all those rollers' speeds. All the rollers in the input
set are driven by some other roller; power is never transferred to
a roller from more than one other roller.

Report your answer as an integer that is the truncated value after
summing all the speeds.

PROBLEM NAME: baler

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Three space-separated integers: N, X_t, and Y_t

* Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 describes roller i's properties: X_i, Y_i,
        and R_i

SAMPLE INPUT:

4 32 54
0 0 10
0 30 20
32 54 20
-40 30 20

INPUT DETAILS:

Four rollers: the drive roller at 0,0 with radius 10. It drives the roller
above it at 0,30 with radius 20. That roller drives both the power take-off
roller at 32,54 (r=20) and a random roller (not in the power train) at
-40,30 (r=20).

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single integer that is the truncated version of the sum of
        the absolute value of the speeds of the rollers in the
        power-train including the drive roller, all the driven
        rollers, and the power take-off roller.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

20000

OUTPUT DETAILS:

 Roller   Radius   Speed
1 (0,0)     10     10,000
2 (0,30)    20     -5,000
3 (32,54)   20      5,000
                   ------
Sum of abs values: 20,000

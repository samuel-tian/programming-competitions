Cow Contest
===========

N (1 <= N <= 100) cows, conveniently numbered 1..N, are participating
in a programming contest. As we all know, some cows code better
than others. Each cow has a certain constant skill rating that is
unique among the competitors.

The contest is conducted in several head-to-head rounds, each between
two cows. If cow A has a greater skill level than cow B (1 <= A <=
N; 1 <= B <= N; A != B), then cow A will always beat cow B.

Farmer John is trying to rank the cows by skill level. Given a list
the results of M (1 <= M <= 4,500) two-cow rounds, determine the
number of cows whose ranks can be precisely determined from the
results. It is guaranteed that the results of the rounds will not
be contradictory.

PROBLEM NAME: contest

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: N and M

* Lines 2..M+1: Each line contains two space-separated integers that
describe the competitors and results (the first integer, A, is
the winner) of a single round of competition: A and B

SAMPLE INPUT:

5 5
4 3
4 2
3 2
1 2
2 5


OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single integer representing the number of cows whose ranks
can be determined

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

2

OUTPUT DETAILS:

Cow 2 loses to cows 1, 3, and 4. Thus, cow 2 is no better than any
of the cows 1, 3, and 4. Cow 5 loses to cow 2, so cow 2 is better
than cow 5. Thus, cow 2 must be fourth, and cow 5 must be fifth.
The ranks of the other cows cannot be determined.

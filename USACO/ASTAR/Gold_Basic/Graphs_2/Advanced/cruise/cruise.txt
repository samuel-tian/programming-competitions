Luxury River Cruise
===================

Farmer John is taking Bessie and the cows on a cruise! They are
sailing on a network of rivers with N ports (1 <= N <= 1,000)
labeled 1..N, and Bessie starts at port 1. Each port has exactly
two rivers leading out of it which lead directly to other ports,
and rivers can only be sailed one way.

At each port, the tour guides choose either the "left" river or
the "right" river to sail down next, but they keep repeating the
same choices over and over. More specifically, the tour guides have
chosen a short sequence of M directions (1 <= M <= 500), each
either "left" or "right", and have repeated it K times (1 <= K <=
1,000,000,000). Bessie thinks she is going in circles -- help her
figure out where she ends up!

PROBLEM NAME: cruise

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Three space-separated integers N, M, and K.

* Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 has two space-separated integers,
        representing the number of the ports that port i's left and
        right rivers lead to, respectively.

* Lines N+2..N+2: M space-separated characters, either 'L' or 'R'.
        'L' represents a choice of  'left' and 'R' represents a
        choice of 'right'.

SAMPLE INPUT:

4 3 3
2 4
3 1
4 2
1 3
L L R

INPUT DETAILS:

The port numbers are arranged clockwise in a circle, with 'L' being
a clockwise rotation and 'R' being a counterclockwise rotation. The
sequence taken is LLRLLRLLR.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single integer giving the number of the port where
        Bessie's cruise ends.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

4

OUTPUT DETAILS:

After the first iteration of the sequence of directions, Bessie is at
port 2 (1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2); after the second, she is at port 3 (2 -> 3
-> 4 -> 3), and at the end she is at port 4 (3 -> 4 -> 1 -> 4).

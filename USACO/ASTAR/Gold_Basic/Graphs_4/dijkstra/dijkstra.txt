Dijkstra's Shortest Path
========================

Given a graph with V (1 <= V <= 2,500) vertices with E bidirectional
edges and a source node S (1 <= S <= V), output the shortest
distance from S to every node (including itself). Each edge
connects two verticies A_i and B_i (1 <= A_i, B_i <= V) and has
a length of C_i (1 <= C_i <= 10,000). If there is no path from S
to a certain node, output -1.

PROBLEM NAME: dijkstra

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Three space-separated integers: V, E, and S

* Line 2...E+1: Three space-separated integers: A_i, B_i, and C_i

SAMPLE INPUT:

6 5 1
3 4 5
5 6 4
1 2 6
3 2 3
3 1 2

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1...V: Line i contains the distance from node S to node i.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

0
5
2

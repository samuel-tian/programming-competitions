Rivers
======

Nearly all of the Kingdom of Byteland is covered by forests and 
rivers. Small rivers meet to form bigger rivers, which also meet 
and, in the end, all the rivers flow together into one big river. 
The big river meets the sea near Bytetown. 

There are n lumberjacks' villages in Byteland, each placed near 
a river. Currently, there is a big sawmill in Bytetown that 
processes all trees cut in the Kingdom. The trees float from the 
villages down the rivers to the sawmill in Bytetown. The king of 
Byteland decided to build k additional sawmills in villages to 
reduce the cost of transporting the trees downriver. After 
building the sawmills, the trees need not float to Bytetown, but 
can be processed in the first sawmill they encounter downriver. 
Obviously, the trees cut near a village with a sawmill need not 
be transported by river. It should be noted that the rivers in 
Byteland do not fork. Therefore, for each village, there is a 
unique way downriver from the village to Bytetown.

The king's accountants calculated how many trees are cut by each 
village per year. You must decide where to build the sawmills to 
minimize the total cost of transporting the trees per year. River 
transportation costs one cent per kilometer, per tree.

Write a program that reads the number of villages, the number of 
additional sawmills to be built, the number of trees cut near each 
village, and descriptions of the rivers, calculates the minimal 
cost of river transportation after building additional sawmills.

PROBLEM NAME: rivers

The first line of input contains two integers: N - the number of 
villages other than Bytetown (2 <= N <= 100), and K - the number 
of additional sawmills to be built (1 <= K <= 50 and K <= N). The 
villages are numbered 1, 2, ..., N, while Bytetown has number 0.

Each of the following N lines contains three integers, separated 
by single spaces. Line i + 1 contains:

* w_i - the number of trees cut near village i per year 
(0 <= w_i <= 10,000),

* v_i - the first village (or Bytetown) downriver from village i 
(0 <= v_i <= N),

* d_i - the distance (in kilometers) by river from village i to v_i 
(1 <= d_i <= 10,000).

It is guaranteed that the total cost of floating all the trees to 
the sawmill in Bytetown in one year does not exceed 2,000,000,000 
cents. In 50 % of test cases N will not exceed 20.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

The first and only line of the output should contain one integer: 
the minimal cost of river transportation (in cents).

OUTPUT DETAILS:



The picture illustrates the example input data. Village numbers 
are given inside circles. Numbers below the circles represents 
the number of trees cut near villages. Numbers above the arrows 
represent rivers' lengths.

The sawmills should be built in villages 2 and 3.

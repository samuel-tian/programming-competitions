Nearby Cows
===========

Farmer John has noticed that his cows often move between nearby 
fields. Taking this into account, he wants to plant enough grass 
in each of his fields not only for the cows situated initially 
in that field, but also for cows visiting from nearby fields.

Specifically, FJ's farm consists of N fields (1 <= N <= 100,000), 
where some pairs of fields are connected with bi-directional 
trails (N-1 of them in total). FJ has designed the farm so that 
between any two fields i and j, there is a unique path made up of 
trails connecting between i and j. Field i is home to C(i) cows, 
although cows sometimes move to a different field by crossing up 
to K trails (1 <= K <= 20).  

FJ wants to plant enough grass in each field i to feed the maximum 
number of cows, M(i), that could possibly end up in that field -- 
that is, the number of cows that can potentially reach field i by 
following at most K trails. Given the structure of FJ's farm and 
the value of C(i) for each field i, please help FJ compute M(i) 
for every field i.

PROBLEM NAME: nearcows

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers, N and K.

* Lines 2..N: Each line contains two space-separated integers, i 
        and j (1 <= i,j <= N) indicating that fields i and j are 
        directly connected by a trail.

* Lines N+1..2N: Line N+i contains the integer C(i). 
        (0 <= C(i) <= 1000)

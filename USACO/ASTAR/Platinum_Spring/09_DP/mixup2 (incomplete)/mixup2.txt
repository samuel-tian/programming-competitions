Mixed Up Cows
=============

Each of Farmer John's N (4 <= N <= 16) cows has a unique serial
number S_i (1 <= S_i <= 25,000). The cows are so proud of it that
each one now wears her number in a gangsta manner engraved in large
letters on a gold plate hung around her ample bovine neck.

Gangsta cows are rebellious and line up to be milked in an order
called 'Mixed Up'. A cow order is 'Mixed Up' if the sequence of
serial numbers formed by their milking line is such that the serial
numbers of every pair of consecutive cows in line differs by more
than K (1 <= K <= 3400). For example, if N = 6 and K = 1 then 1,
3, 5, 2, 6, 4 is a 'Mixed Up' lineup but 1, 3, 6, 5, 2, 4 is not
(since the consecutive numbers 5 and 6 differ by 1).

How many different ways can N cows be Mixed Up?

PROBLEM NAME: mixup2

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: N and K

* Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 contains a single integer that is the serial
        number of cow i: S_i

SAMPLE INPUT:

4 1
3
4
2
1

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single integer that is the number of ways that N cows can
        be 'Mixed Up'. The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 64 bit
        integer.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

2

OUTPUT DETAILS:

The 2 possible Mixed Up arrangements are:
3 1 4 2
2 4 1 3

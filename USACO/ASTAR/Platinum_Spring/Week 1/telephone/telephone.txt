Cow Telephones
==============

The cows have set up a telephone network, which for the purposes
of this problem can be considered to be an unrooted tree of unspecified
degree with N (1 <= N <= 100,000) vertices conveniently numbered
1..N. Each vertex represents a telephone switchboard, and each edge
represents a telephone wire between two switchboards. Edge i is
specified by two integers A_i and B_i the are the two vertices
joined by edge i (1 <= A_i <= N; 1 <= B_i <= N; A_i != B_i).

Some switchboards have only one telephone wire connecting them to
another switchboard; these are the leaves of the tree, each of which
is a telephone booth located in a cow field.

For two cows to communicate, their conversation passes along the
unique shortest path between the two vertices where the cows are
located. A switchboard can accomodate only up to K (1 <= K <= 10)
simultaneous conversations, and there can be at most one conversation
going through a given wire at any one time.

Given that there is a cow at each leaf of the tree, what is the
maximum number of pairs of cows that can simultaneously hold
conversations? A cow can, of course, participate in at most one
conversation.

Consider this six-node telephone tree with K=1:

       1   5          C1   C5
       |   |          ||   ||
       2---4   -->    |2---4|
       |   |          ||   ||
       3   6          C3   C6

There are four cows, located at vertices 1, 3, 5 and 6. If cow 1
talks to cow 3, and cow 5 talks to cow 6, then they do not exceed
the maximum number of conversations per switchboard, so for this
example the answer is 2 (for two pairs of cows talking simultaneously).

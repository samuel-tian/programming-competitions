Cow Jogging
===========

Bessie has taken heed of the evils of sloth and has decided to get
fit by jogging from the barn to the pond several times a week. She
doesn't want to work too hard, of course, so she only plans to jog
downhill to the pond and then amble back to the barn at her leisure.

Bessie also doesn't want to jog any too far either, so she generally
takes the shortest sequence of cow paths to get to the pond. Each
of the M (1 <= M <= 10,000) cowpaths connects two pastures conveniently
numbered 1..N (1 <= N <= 1000). Even more conveniently, the pastures
are numbered such that if X>Y then the path from pasture X to pasture
Y runs downhill. Pasture N is the barn (at the top of the hill) and
pasture 1 is the pond (at the bottom).

Just a week into her regimen, Bessie has begun to tire of always
taking the same route to get to the pond. She would like to vary
her route by taking different paths on different days. Specifically,
Bessie would like to take exactly K (1 <= K <= 100) different routes
for variety. To avoid too much exertion, she wants these to be the
K shortest routes from the barn to the pond. Two routes are considered
different if they comprise different sequences of cowpaths.

Help Bessie determine how strenuous her workout will be by determining
the lengths of each of the K shortest paths on the network of
pastures. You will be supplied a list of downhill paths from X_i
to Y_i along with the path's length: (X_i, Y_i, D_i) where (1 <=
Y_i < X_i; Y_i < X_i <= N). Cowpath i has length D_i (1 <= D_i
<= 1,000,000).

PROBLEM NAME: cowjog

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Three space-separated integers: N, M, and K

* Lines 2..M+1: Line i+1 describes a downhill path using three
        space-separated integers: X_i, Y_i, and D_i

SAMPLE INPUT:

5 8 7
5 4 1
5 3 1
5 2 1
5 1 1
4 3 4
3 1 1
3 2 1
2 1 1

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Lines 1..K: Line i contains the length of the i-th shortest path or
        -1 if no such path exists. If a shortest path length occurs
        multiple times, be sure to list it multiple times in the
        output.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

1
2
2
3
6
7
-1

OUTPUT DETAILS:

The paths are (5-1), (5-3-1), (5-2-1), (5-3-2-1), (5-4-3-1), (5-4-3-2-1).

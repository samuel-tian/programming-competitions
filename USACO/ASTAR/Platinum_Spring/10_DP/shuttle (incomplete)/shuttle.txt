Fair Shuttle
============

Although Farmer John has no problems walking around the fair to
collect prizes or see the shows, his cows are not in such good
shape; a full day of walking around the fair leaves them exhausted.
To help them enjoy the fair, FJ has arranged for a shuttle truck
to take the cows from place to place in the fairgrounds.

FJ couldn't afford a really great shuttle, so the shuttle he rented
traverses its route only once (!) and makes N (1 <= N <= 20,000)
stops (conveniently numbered 1..N) along its path. A total of K (1
<= K <= 50,000) groups of cows conveniently numbered 1..K wish to
use the shuttle, each of the M_i (1 <= M_i <= N) cows in group i
wanting to ride from one stop S_i (1 <= S_i < E_i) to another stop
E_i (S_i < E_i <= N) farther along the route.

The shuttle might not be able to pick up an entire group of cows
(since it has limited capacity) but can pick up partial groups as
appropriate.

Given the capacity C (1 <= C <= 100) of the shuttle truck and the
descriptions of the groups of cows that want to visit various sites
at the fair, determine the maximum number of cows that can ride the
shuttle during the fair.

PROBLEM NAME: shuttle

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Three space-separated integers: K, N, and C

* Lines 2..K+1: Line i+1 describes group i of the cows with three
        space-separated integers: S_i, E_i, and M_i

SAMPLE INPUT:

8 15 3
1 5 2
13 14 1
5 8 3
8 14 2
14 15 1
9 12 1
12 15 2
4 6 1

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The maximum number of cows that can ride the shuttle at the
        fair.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

10

OUTPUT DETAILS:

The shuttle can take 2 cows from stop 1 to stop 5, 3 from 5 to 8, 2 from 8
to 14, 1 from 9 to 12, 1 from 13 to 14, and 1 from 14 to 15.

Wormholes
=========

While exploring his many farms, Farmer John has discovered a number
of amazing wormholes. A wormhole is very peculiar because it is a
one-way path that delivers you to its destination at a time that
is BEFORE you entered the wormhole! Each of FJ's farms comprises N
(1 <= N <= 500) fields conveniently numbered 1..N, M (1 <= M <=
2500) paths, and W (1 <= W <= 200) wormholes.

As FJ is an avid time-traveling fan, he wants to do the following:
start at some field, travel through some paths and wormholes, and
return to the starting field a time before his initial departure.
Perhaps he will be able to meet himself :) .

To help FJ find out whether this is possible or not, he will supply
you with complete maps to F (1 <= F <= 5) of his farms.  No paths
will take longer than 10,000 seconds to travel and no wormhole can
bring FJ back in time by more than 10,000 seconds.

PROBLEM NAME: wormhole

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single integer, F. F farm descriptions follow.

* Line 1 of each farm: Three space-separated integers respectively: N,
        M, and W

* Lines 2..M+1 of each farm: Three space-separated numbers (S, E, T)
        that describe, respectively: a bidirectional path between S
        and E that requires T seconds to traverse. Two fields might be
        connected by more than one path.

* Lines M+2..M+W+1 of each farm: Three space-separated numbers (S, E,
        T) that describe, respectively: A one way path from S to E
        that also moves the traveler back T seconds.

SAMPLE INPUT:

1 2 2
1 3 4
2 3 1
3 1 3
3 2 1
1 2 3
2 3 4
3 1 8


INPUT DETAILS:

Two farm maps. The first has three paths and one wormhole, and the
second has two paths and one wormhole.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Lines 1..F: For each farm, output "YES" if FJ can achieve his goal,
        otherwise output "NO" (do not include the quotes).

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

NO
YES

OUTPUT DETAILS:

For farm 1, FJ cannot travel back in time.
For farm 2, FJ could travel back in time by the cycle 1->2->3->1, arriving
back at his starting location 1 second before he leaves. He could start
from anywhere on the cycle to accomplish this.

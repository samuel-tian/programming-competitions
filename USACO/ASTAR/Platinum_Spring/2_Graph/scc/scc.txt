Strongly Connected Components
=============================

You are given a directed graph with N nodes and N edges. 
You should find the number of strongly connected components 
of this graph. 

Strongly connected component can be defined as a subgraph 
that contains nodes that are pairwise reachable to each other. 

PROBLEM NAME: scc

INPUT FORMAT:

The first line contains a single integer N (1 <= N <= 50,000). 
For the following N lines, ith line contains an integer x, 
meaning that there is an edge from node i to node x. 

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Output should contain a single integer denoting
the number of the strongly connected components.

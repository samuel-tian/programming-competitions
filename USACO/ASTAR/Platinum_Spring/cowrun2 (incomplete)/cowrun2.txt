Cow Run
=======

Farmer John and Bessie have devised a new exercise game for the 
cows. The cows are running on a circular track of length M (2 <= 
M <= 1,000,000,000) starting from the same position. The game 
proceeds in N (1 <= N <= 14) rounds using a deck of 8N cards each 
with a number X_i (0 <= X_i < M) written on it.

Each round FJ moves the top 8 cards into a separate pile and 
selects either the top 4 or bottom 4 cards for Bessie to play 
with. Bessie then chooses either the top 2 or bottom 2 cards of 
the 4 cards FJ selected. After this FJ calls out the number on 
the top card, X_top, and the cows run a distance of R * X_top, 
where R is the total distance the cows have run so far. Bessie 
then calls out the number on the bottom card, X_bottom, and the 
cows run a distance of X_bottom.

FJ is concerned that after the exercise the cows will be too tired 
to get back to the beginning of the track if they end up too far 
away. He believes if the cows end up more than a distance of K 
(0 <= K <= floor(M/2)) from their starting position they won't be 
able to get back home.

It is guaranteed that if FJ chooses correctly, he will always be 
able to ensure the cows can come home, irrespective of the moves 
made by Bessie! For each round, your task is to determine which 
half of the cards FJ should choose such that no matter what 
Bessie does from that point on, FJ can always get the cows home. 
Bessie will then make the move provided in the input and you can 
then continue onto the next round. Note that even though Bessie's 
moves are provided to you in the input, you are to specify moves
for FJ that would have worked no matter what Bessie chooses (so 
it is effectively as if FJ does not really know what Bessie will 
do during her moves).

PROBLEM NAME: cowrun2

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Three space-separated integers N, M, K

* Line 2: A string N characters. If the ith character is 'T' it 
        means Bessy will select the top 2 cards in the ith round. 
        Otherwise the ith character will be 'B' to indicate Bessy 
        will select the bottom 2 cards in the ith round.

* Lines 3..2+N: Each line contains eight integers representing 
        the 8 cards to be used that round from top to bottom.

SAMPLE INPUT:

2 2 0
TT
1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A string of N characters where the ith character is 'T' 
        if FJ should choose the top 4 cards or 'B' if FJ should 
        choose the bottom 4 cards in the ith round. If there are 
        multiple ways to get the cows home, choose the 
        lexicographically first (that is, the string that is 
        alphabetically smallest).

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

TB

OUTPUT DETAILS:

The cows must end up exactly where they started to be able to come 
home. Note that FJ is not aware of what choices Bessie is going to 
make beforehand. If FJ did know, he could have chosen the bottom 
half each time.

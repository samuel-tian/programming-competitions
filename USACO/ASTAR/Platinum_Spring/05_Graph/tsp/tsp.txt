Travelling Salesman Problem
===========================

Given N cities (1 < N < 20) and M two-way roads between cities, 
the problem is to find the shortest possible path that visits 
every city exactly once.

PROBLEM NAME: tsp

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: N and M.

* Line 2..M+1: three space-separated integers: V1, V2 and D
        Distance D of the road between cities V1 and V2 
        (0 < D <= 1000).

SAMPLE INPUT:

5 8
3 5 8
5 4 11
2 5 7
5 1 12
4 2 10
1 2 4
4 3 6
3 2 9

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A line containing a single integer, the total distance
        of the shortest path that travels all cities exactly once. 
        If it is impossible output "IMPOSSIBLE".

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

25

OUTPUT DETAILS:

One can travel using the path 1-2-5-3-4. The total distance is
4 + 7 + 8 + 6 = 25.

Fencing the Cows
================

Farmer John wishes to build a fence to contain his cows, but he's a
bit short on cash right. Any fence he builds must contain all of the
favorite grazing spots for his cows. Given the location of these
spots, determine the length of the shortest fence which encloses them.

PROGRAM NAME: fc

INPUT FORMAT:

The first line of the input file contains one integer, N. N (0 <= N
<= 10,000) is the number of grazing spots that Farmer john wishes to
enclose. The next N line consists of two real numbers, Xi and Yi,
corresponding to the location of the grazing spots in the plane
(-1,000,000 <= Xi,Yi <= 1,000,000). The numbers will be in decimal
format.

SAMPLE INPUT:

4
4 8
4 12
5 9.3
7 8

OUTPUT FORMAT:

The output should consists of one real number, the length of fence
required. The output should be accurate to two decimal places.

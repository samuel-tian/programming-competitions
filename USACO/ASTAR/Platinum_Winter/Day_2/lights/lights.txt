Lights
======

Bessie and the cows were playing games in the barn, but the power
was reset and the lights were all turned off. Help the cows get all
the lights back on so they can resume their games.

The N (1 <= N <= 35) lights conveniently numbered 1..N and their
switches are arranged in a complex network with M (1 <= M <= 595)
clever connection between pairs of lights (see below).

Each light has a switch that, when toggled, causes that light --
and all of the lights that are connected to it -- to change their
states (from on to off, or off to on).

Find the minimum number of switches that need to be toggled in order
to turn all the lights back on.

It's guaranteed that there is at least one way to toggle the switches
so all lights are back on.

PROBLEM NAME: lights

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: N and M.

* Lines 2..M+1: Each line contains two space-separated integers
        representing two lights that are connected. No pair will be
        repeated.

SAMPLE INPUT:

5 6
1 2
1 3
4 2
3 4
2 5
5 3

INPUT DETAILS:

There are 5 lights. Lights 1, 4, and 5 are each connected to both lights 2
and 3.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single integer representing the minimum number of switches
        that need to be flipped in order to turn on all the lights.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

3

OUTPUT DETAILS:

Toggle the switches on lights 1, 4, and 5.

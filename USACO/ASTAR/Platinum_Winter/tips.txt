for graph algorithms:
    if finding a minimum or a maximum, try binary searching on the answer
merging abstract data structures:
    if it is difficult to maintain a dynamic data structure, then maintain
    logN data structures and merge along the way. Data structures are maintained
    by considering 2^k points

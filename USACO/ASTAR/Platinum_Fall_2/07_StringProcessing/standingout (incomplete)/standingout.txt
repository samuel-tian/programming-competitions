Standing Out from the Herd
==========================

Just like humans, cows often appreciate feeling they are unique in 
some way. Since Farmer John's cows all come from the same breed and 
look quite similar, they want to measure uniqueness in their names.

Each cow's name has some number of substrings. For example, "amy" 
has substrings {a, m, y, am, my, amy}, and "tommy" would have the 
following substrings: {t, o, m, y, to, om, mm, my, tom, omm, mmy, 
tomm, ommy, tommy}.

A cow name has a "uniqueness factor" which is the number of substrings 
of that name not shared with any other cow. For example, If amy was 
in a herd by herself, her uniqueness factor would be 6. If tommy was 
in a herd by himself, his uniqueness factor would be 14. If they were 
in a herd together, however, amy's uniqueness factor would be 3 and 
tommy's would be 11.

Given a herd of cows, please determine each cow's uniqueness factor.

PROBLEMS NAME: standingout

INPUT FORMAT:

The first line of input will contain N (1 <= N <= 100,000). The 
following N lines will each contain the name of a cow in the herd. 
Each name will contain only lowercase characters a-z. The total 
length of all names will not exceed 100,000.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Output N numbers, one per line, describing the uniqueness factor of 
each cow.

SAMPLE INPUT:

3
amy
tommy
bessie

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

3
11
19

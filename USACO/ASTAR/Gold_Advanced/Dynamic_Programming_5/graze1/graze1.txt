Finicky Grazers
===============

Farmer John's N (1 <= N <= 10,000) cows (conveniently numbered 1..N)
graze in a straight line in their pasture whose length is L+1 (N
<= L <= 100,000) meters. Every morning, they place themselves at
various unique integer locations along that line. FJ has observed
that the cows produce more milk when the distance to the other
grazing cows is maximized.

Always the enterprising farmer, FJ wants to maximize the distance
between each and every pair of neighboring cows by moving the cows
to the right or left, but always with integer inter-cow spacing and
never changing their order on the line. He spends 1 minute to move
a cow 1 meter. When he's finished, he knows that the distances
between every adjacent pair of cows will be one of two integers: D
or D+1.

Help FJ to calculate minimum time he needs to arrange the positions
of the cows.

PROBLEM NAME: graze1

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers, N and L

* Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 describes cow i with a single integer (range
        0..L) representing the position of a cow; 0 is the left-most
        position. The list is sorted by position with the smallest
        position value first.

SAMPLE INPUT:

5 10
0
1
4
9
10

INPUT DETAILS:

The cows are arranged like this at the start:
1 2 - - 3 - - - - 4 5

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single line with minimum time FJ needs to arrange the
        positions of the  cows.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

3

OUTPUT DETAILS:

The cows end up arranged like this:
1 - 2 - 3 - - 4 - - 5
Cow #2 moves from position 1 to position 2 (1 meter).  Cow #4 moves
from position 9 to position 7 (2 meters).  Other cows don't move.
Moving times are 1+2=3, which is the final answer.

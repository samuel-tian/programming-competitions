Circular Barn
=============

Being a fan of contemporary architecture, Farmer John has built a 
new barn in the shape of a perfect circle. Inside, the barn 
consists of a ring of n rooms, numbered clockwise from 1..n around 
the perimeter of the barn (3 <= n <= 100,000). Each room has doors 
to its two neighboring rooms, and also a door opening to the 
exterior of the barn.

Farmer John owns n cows, and he wants exactly one cow to end up in 
each room in the barn. However, the cows, being slightly confused, 
line up at haphazard doors, with possibly multiple cows lining up 
at the same door. Precisely c_i cows line up outside the door to 
room i, so sum {c_i} = n.

To manage the process of herding the cows so that one cow ends up 
in each room, Farmer John wants to use the following approach: each 
cow enters at the door at which she initially lined up, then walks 
clockwise through the rooms until she reaches a suitable 
destination. Given that a cow walking through d doors consumes d^2 
energy, please determine the minimum amount of energy needed to 
distribute the cows so one ends up in each room.

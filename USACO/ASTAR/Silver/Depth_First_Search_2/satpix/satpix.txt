Satellite Photographs
=====================

Farmer John purchased satellite photos of W x H pixels of his farm
(1 <= W <= 80, 1 <= H <= 1000) and wishes to determine the largest
'contiguous' (connected) pasture. Pastures are contiguous when any
pair of pixels in a pasture can be connected by traversing adjacent
vertical or horizontal pixels that are part of the pasture.  (It is
easy to create pastures with very strange shapes, even circles that
surround other circles.)

Each photo has been digitally enhanced to show pasture area as an
asterisk ('*') and non-pasture area as a period ('.').  Here is a
10 x 5 sample satellite photo:
 
..*.....**
.**..*****
.*...*....
..****.***
..****.***
 
This photo shows three contiguous pastures of 4,  16, and 6 pixels.  
Help FJ find the largest contiguous pasture in each of his satellite
photos.

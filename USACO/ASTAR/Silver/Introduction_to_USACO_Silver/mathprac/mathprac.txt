Math Practice
=============

One lovely afternoon, Bessie's friend Heidi was helping Bessie
review for her upcoming math exam.

Heidi presents two integers A (0 <= A <= 45) and B (1 <= B <= 9)
to Bessie who must respond with an integer E in the range 1..62.
E is the smallest integer in that range that is strictly greater
than A and also has B as the first digit of 2 raised to the E-th
power. If there is no answer, Bessie responds with 0.

Help Bessie correctly answer all of Heidi's questions by calculating
her responses.

By way of example, consider A=1 and B=6. Bessie might generate a table
like this:
         E         2^E    First digit of 2^E
         2          4            4
         3          8            8
         4         16            1
         5         32            3
         6         64            6      <-- matches B

Thus, E=6 is the proper answer.

NOTE: The value of 2^44 does not fit in a normal 32-bit integer.

Parkside's Triangle
===================

Bessie taught the cows to make Parkside's Triangle. It is generated from
two numbers: the size and the seed. The size N (1 <= N <= 20) determines
how many rows are in the triangle and the seed S (1 <= S <= 9) determines
the first number in the triangle. Here are two examples:

 N=5, S=3                  N=6, S=1  

3 4 6 9 4                1 2 4 7 2 7    
  5 7 1 5                  3 5 8 3 8    
    8 2 6                    6 9 4 9    
      3 7                      1 5 1   
        8                        6 2  
                                   3

The first line of any triangle has no blanks at its front.

Analyze the above examples, discover the rule, and write a program
that will generate Parkside's Triangle given any size N (1 <= N <=
20) and any seed S (1 <= S <= 9).

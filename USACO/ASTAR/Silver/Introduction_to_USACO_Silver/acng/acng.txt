Another Cow Number Game
=======================

The cows are playing a silly number game again. Bessie is tired of
losing and wants you to help her cheat. In this game, a cow supplies
a number N (1 <= N <= 1,000,000). This is move 0. If N is odd, then
the number N is multiplied by 3 and incremented by 1. If N is even,
the number N is divided by 2. Each time the number is multiplied
or divided, the score increases by one point. The game ends -- and
the score is finalized -- when N becomes 1. If N is initially 1,
the score is 0.

Here's an example with N starting at 5:
 
        N     Next Value    Comment    Score
        5        16          3*5+1       1
       16         8           16/2       2
        8         4            8/2       3
        4         2            4/2       4
        2         1            2/2       5

The final score is 5.

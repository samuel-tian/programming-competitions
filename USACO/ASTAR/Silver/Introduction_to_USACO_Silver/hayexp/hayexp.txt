Hay Expenses
============

Every day Farmer John feeds the cows a lavish meal of premium gourmet
hay. He then records the number of bales on the next line of his
expense notebook.

When tax time comes, FJ realizes that he neglected to record the
dates for the hay feedings. He must calculate a number of different
totals of successive hay feedings in order to solve the puzzle of
which feedings went with which month of expenses.

FJ has created a dataset with N (4 <= N <= 500) days conveniently
numbered 1..N of hay bale counts H_i (1 <= H_i <= 1,000). He has
an additional Q (1 <= Q <= 500) queries -- each query is a pair of
integers S_j and E_j (1 <= S_j <= E_j <= N) that denote that start
and end indices of some hay bale counts.  Your job is to sum the
hay bale counts for the days S_j..E_j (inclusive) and report one
sum for each query.

PROBLEM NAME: hayexp

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: N and Q

* Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 contains a single hay bale count for day i:
        H_i

* Lines N+2..N+Q+1: Line j+N+1 describes query j with a pair of
        integers: S_j and E_j

SAMPLE INPUT:

4 2
5
8
12
6
1 3
2 4

INPUT DETAILS:

Four days; two queries.  Bale counts: 5, 8, 12, and 6. Count
Days 1..3 and 2..4.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Lines 1..Q: Line j of the output file contains a single integer that
        is the sum of the hay bale counts for days S_j through E_j

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

25
26

OUTPUT DETAILS:

Days:      1 2  3  4 
Counts:    5 8 12  6

query 1..3:  5 + 8 + 12 = 25
query 2..4:  8 + 12 + 6 = 26

Coggle
======

Like everyone else on their vacation, the cows play the cow version of the
word game called Boggle: Coggle. It's a similar game where 25
letter dice are rolled into a matrix like this one:

           Z C C D X
           K Q M N B
           U O W Z Y
           F C O I J
           P A Q Z T

Words are made (and thus points scored) by starting at some letter
and proceeding to one of its (as many as) eight neighbors, etc.
until the successive letters spell out a word from a dictionary

In the matrix above, the lower 'C' can be used to form the words
"CAP", "COW", and "COOK" (but not "COD" or "PACK"). The complete
list of dictionary words for the above square is: "CAP", "COOK",
"COW", "OWN", "WIT", "WOO", "ZOO", and "ZOOM".

Help Bessie see how good she can do. Read in five rows of five
letters that represent the dice and see how many words from the
dictionary can be formed.  Don't use any given die's letter twice.

Count the number of words that can be formed (a number that might
well be smaller than the number of ways a word a can be formed since
words might be formed in more than one way).

3D Space Exploration
====================

Farmer John's cows have finally blasted off from earth and are now
floating around space in their Moocraft. The cows want to reach
their fiery kin on Io, a moon of Jupiter, but to do so they first
must navigate the dangerous asteroid belt.

Bessie is piloting the craft and must guide it through this treacherous
N x N x N (1 <= N <= 100) sector of space. All asteroids in this
sector comprise some number of 1 x 1 x 1 blocks of space-rock
connected along their faces (two blocks sharing only a vertex or
only an edge count as two distinct asteroids).

Please help Bessie by counting the number of distinct asteroids in
the field.

Consider a 3 x 3 x 3 space where the first slice of space looks
like this, with 'M' indicating the starting location of the Moocraft
(1,1,1) and 'D' is the destination at (3,3,3). In these maps, these
markers serve mostly as map orientation rather than providing useful
information to solve the problem.

In these diagrams and also in the input file, the *'s represent
asteroid chunks and each '.' represents a vast void of empty space.

Visual inspection shows three asteroids, including a long one through
the middle of the map. Here's a map with the asteroid pieces labelled:

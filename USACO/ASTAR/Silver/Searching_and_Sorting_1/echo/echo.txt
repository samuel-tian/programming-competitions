Barn Echoes
===========

The cows enjoy mooing at the barn because their moos echo back,
although sometimes not completely. Bessie, ever the excellent
secretary, has been recording the exact wording of the moo as it
goes out and returns. She is curious as to just how much overlap
there is.

Given two lines of input (letters from the set a..z, total length
in the range 1..80), each of which has the wording of a moo on it,
determine the greatest number of characters of overlap between one
string and the other. A string is an overlap between two other
strings if it is a prefix of one string and a suffix of the other
string.

By way of example, consider two moos:

     moyooyoxyzooo
     yzoooqyasdfljkamo

The last part of the first string overlaps 'yzooo' with the first
part of the second string. The last part of the second string
overlaps 'mo' with the first part of the first string. The largest
overlap is 'yzooo' whose length is 5.

PROBLEM NAME: echo

INPUT FORMAT:

* Lines 1..2: Each line has the text of a moo or its echo

SAMPLE INPUT:

abcxxxxabcxabcd
abcdxabcxxxxabcx

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single line with a single integer that is the length of
        the longest overlap between the front of one string and end of
        the other.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

11

OUTPUT DETAILS:

'abcxxxxabcx' is a prefix of the first string and a suffix of the second
string.

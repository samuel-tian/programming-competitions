Minesweeper
===========

Farmer John has an N x M field (1 <= N,M <= 30). Cows installed K mines
into the field as a prank. FJ luckily found the map that cows used when 
installing the mines. The map shows the N x M field. In the map, each 
square has an integer value that reflects the number of mines that 
square touches - including itself and all eight directions. FJ also knows 
that there is at most one mine in each square. Help FJ to determine the 
locations of the mines. In case there are more than one solution, output
lexicographically the first one with respect to the coordinates of mines.

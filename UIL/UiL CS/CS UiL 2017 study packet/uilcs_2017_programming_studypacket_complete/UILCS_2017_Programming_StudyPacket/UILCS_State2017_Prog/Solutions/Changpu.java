State - Changpu

Changpu has just learned about numbers and their complements, especially since that is different than the opposite of a number.
He decided to write a simple program to test his newfound knowledge, but needs a little help.
For fun he wants to take all even numbers, either positive or negative, and print their complement, otherwise just print their opposite value.

Input: A series of two-digit integers, all on one line, with single space separation.
Output: For each input integer N, if it is even, print N and its complement value, otherwise print N and its opposite value, with single space separation.

Sample Input:
83 -70 81 -13 51

Sample Output:
83 -83
-70 69
81 -81
-13 13
51 -51

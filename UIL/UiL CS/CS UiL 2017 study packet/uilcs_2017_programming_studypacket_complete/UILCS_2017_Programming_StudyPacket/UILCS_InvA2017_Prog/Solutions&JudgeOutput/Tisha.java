Tisha - No file - simple output

Making ASCII character face patterns is so much fun for Tisha, and she wants you to join her 
in making a face pattern of your own.

Create an 8X8 character pattern using characters that can be generated from the
keyboard, or if you can, other characters you might know of, like box characters.

The entire pattern must span exactly eight rows and eight columns, with at least one 
character on each row, and at least one in each column. There must be at least one \ (backslash) character
and one " (double quote) character in the pattern.

Input: None

Output: A unique face pattern, of your own creation, as described above.

Here is an 8X8 dash pattern to help you sketch out your creation.

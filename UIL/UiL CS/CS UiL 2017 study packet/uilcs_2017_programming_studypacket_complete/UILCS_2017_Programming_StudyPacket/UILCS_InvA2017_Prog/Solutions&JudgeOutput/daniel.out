Be

they can't ignore
you. - Steve Martin

Ever
tried? Ever
failed? No matter.
Try again. Fail again.
Fail better. - Samuel Beckett

Impossible
is just
a big word
thrown around by small
men who find it easier
to live in the world they've
been given than to explore the
power
they have
to change it.
Impossible is not a
fact. It's an opinion.
Impossible
is not
a declaration. It's
a dare. Impossible is
potential. Impossible is
temporary.
Impossible is
nothing. - Muhammed
Ali

At
the end
of the day,
let there be no
excuses, no explanations, no
regrets.

Every
life form
seems to strive
to its maximum except
human beings. How tall will
a tree grow? As tall as
it possibly can. Human beings,
on
the other
hand, have been
given the dignity of
choice. You can choose to
be all or you can choose
to be less. Why not stretch up
to the full measure of the
challenge
and see
what all you
can do? - Jim
Rohn

I
AM THAT

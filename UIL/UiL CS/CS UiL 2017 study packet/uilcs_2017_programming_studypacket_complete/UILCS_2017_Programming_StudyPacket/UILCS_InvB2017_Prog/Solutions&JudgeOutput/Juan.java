UIL 2017 - Owen Solution

Invitational B - Juan has just joined the UIL team at his school and knows a little bit about programming,
but not too much.  He decides to submit to the judges a simple output programming that introduces his team, 
hoping they will give him some points for it.  He only includes the first names of his team, 
and the initials of his high school, in order to maintain some anonymity. 

Input: None

Output: The first name of each of your team’s members, followed by the initials of your school, each on one line.
 
Sample output:
Tom
Janie
Kendra
Joe
AHS

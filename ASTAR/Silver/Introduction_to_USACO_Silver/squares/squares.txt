Perfect Squares
===============

Farmer John is playing a game with Bessie. He picks two positive
integers A and B (1 = B = A = 500), and Bessie is supposed to
deduce which numbers he picked. He gave Bessie the following hint

The numbers I chose have the property that the square of the
larger number is N (1 = N = 1,000) larger than the square of
the smaller number.

Being a smart cow, Bessie knows that this hint will greatly reduce the
number of possibilities for A and B. However, she is asking you to help by
writing a program to compute the exact number of solutions possible.

PROBLEM NAME squares

INPUT FORMAT

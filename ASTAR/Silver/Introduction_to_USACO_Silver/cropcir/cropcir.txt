Crop Circles
============

Bessie and her fellow herd-mates have become extremely territorial.
The N (1 <= N <= 400) cows conveniently numbered 1..N have all
staked out a grazing spot in the pasture. Each cow i has a spot on
an integer grid (0 <= X_i <= 10,000; 0 <= Y_i <= 10,000) and an
integer radius R_i that indicates the circle she is staking out (1
<= R_i <= 500).

The cows are a bit greedy and sometimes stake out territory of their
herd-mates. For each cow, calculate the number of other cows whose
territory overlaps her territory.

NOTE: the test data will avoid pathological situations like tangents
where the circles just barely touch.

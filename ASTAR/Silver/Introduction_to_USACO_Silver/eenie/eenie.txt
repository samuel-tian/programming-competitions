Eenie Meenie Miney Moe
======================

"Eenie, meenie, miney, moe... catch a heifer by the toe," an
exasperated Bessie muttered. She could never get the syllables right
when choosing calves for game playing. Today she is trying to see
which of N (1 <= N <= 2,300) heifers conveniently numbered 1..N
will get a special hunk of hay made from tender spring grass.
Thus, Bessie is leaving it up to you. You will be provided a list
of integers. This list is of length L (1 <= L <= 10) and describes
a sort of "elimination sequence" containing integers in the range
(1..N). If the N heifers are lined up in order in a circle, then
the elimination count starts at heifer number 1. The L_1 th
heifer is eliminated. Start at the next heifer, the count proceeds
for L_2 more heifers to find the baby cow to be eliminated.
Both the line of heifers and the elimination sequence are circular,
wrapping around as necessary.

By way of example, consider a set of 8 heifers and an elimination
sequence of {5, 3}. Initially, the 8 heifers form a circle as
shown in Figure A.

Starting at heifer 1, count 5 cows and eliminate the 5th one (Figure
B). Now count 3 more and eliminate the 3rd cow, which is number 8
(Figure C).

The elimination list is exhausted so it is recycled. Count five
more heifers and eliminate the fifth one, which is number 6 (Figure
D) since number 5 is no longer present. Now count three more to
eliminate the third cow, number 2 (Figure E). Recycle the list and
count five more to eliminate number 3 (Figure F). Count three more
to eliminate number 1 (Figure G), and finally count five more to
eliminate number 4 (Figure H).

Heifer 7 is left standing.

PROBLEM NAME: eenie

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: N and L

* Line 2: L space-separated integers (range 1..N) that respectively
        compose the elimination sequence.

SAMPLE INPUT:

8 2
5 3

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single integer that is the number of the heifer left
        standing (who will receive the special hay treat)

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

7

Cow Counting
============

Farmer John wants to label his N (1 <= N <= 1,000,000) cows, but
cows don't like having the digit L (0 <= L <= 9) written on them,
so he avoids that.

If the cows are labeled with the smallest set of N positive integers
that don't have the digit L, what is the largest number that Farmer
John has to write on any cow?

PROBLEM NAME: count

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: N and L.

SAMPLE INPUT:

10 1

INPUT DETAILS:

Farmer John has 10 cows he needs to label without using the digit 1.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single integer that is the largest number that Farmer John
        has to write on any cow.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

22

OUTPUT DETAILS:

The smallest 10 numbers he can use are: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 20, and 22.

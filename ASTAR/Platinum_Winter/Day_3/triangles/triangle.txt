Lots of Triangles
=================

Farmer John is thinking of selling some of his land to earn a bit of
extra income. His property contains n trees (3 <= N <= 300), each
described by a point in the 2D plane, no three of which are
collinear. FJ is thinking about selling triangular lots of land
defined by having trees at their vertices; there are of course
L=C(N,3) such lots he can consider, based on all possible triples of
trees on his property.

A triangular lot has value v if it contains exactly v trees in its
interior (the trees on the corners do not count, and note that there
are no trees on the boundaries since no three trees are collinear).
For every v=0..N-3, please help FJ determine how many of his L
potential lots have value v.

PROBLEM NAME: triangles

INPUT FORMAT:

The first line of input contains N.

The following N lines contain the x and y coordinates of a single
tree; these are both integers in the range 0..1,000,000.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Output N-2 lines, where output line i contains a count of the number
of lots having value i-1.

SAMPLE INPUT:

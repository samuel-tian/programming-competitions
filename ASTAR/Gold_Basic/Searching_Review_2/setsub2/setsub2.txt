Sets - Subsets 2
================

You are given a set of numbers from 1 to 9. Print all subsets
except the empty set that can be formed by the numbers in the
given set. The subsets should be ordered in a specific way from
1 to 2^N-1. Subset K should correspond to the bitset of K. For
instance given the numbers 4 3 8, then subset 5 should be {4,8}
since 5 is 101 in binary. 101 means the first and the last numbers
are in the subset whereas the second one is not.

For the numbers 4 3 8, the subset order should be as follows:

subset #  binary  subset
--------  ------  ------
   1        001   {4}
   2        010   {3}
   3        011   {4,3}
   4        100   {8}
   5        101   {4,8}
   6        110   {3,8}
   7        111   {4,3,8}

Catch That Cow
==============

Farmer John has been informed of the location of a fugitive cow
and wants to catch her immediately. He starts at a point N
(0 <= N <= 100,000) on a number line and the cow is at a point K
(0 <= K <= 100,000) on the same number line. Farmer John has
two modes of transportation: walking and teleporting.

* Walking: FJ can move from any point X to the points X - 1
or X + 1 in a single minute

* Teleporting: FJ can move from any point X to the point
2 * X in a single minute.

If the cow, unaware of its pursuit, does not move at all,
how long does it take for Farmer John to retrieve it?

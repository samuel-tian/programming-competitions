There are two coal mines, each employing a group of miners. Mining 
coal is hard work, so miners need food to keep at it. Every time a 
shipment of food arrives at their mine, the miners produce some 
amount of coal. There are three types of food shipments: meat 
shipments, fish shipments and bread shipments.

Miners like variety in their diet and they will be more productive 
if their food supply is kept varied. More precisely, every time a 
new shipment arrives to their mine, they will consider the new 
shipment and the previous two shipments (or fewer if there haven't 
been that many) and then:

* If all shipments were of the same type, they will produce one 
unit of coal.
* If there were two different types of food among the shipments, 
they will produce two units of coal.
* If there were three different types of food, they will produce 
three units of coal.

We know in advance the types of food shipments and the order in 
which they will be sent. It is possible to influence the amount of 
coal that is produced by determining which shipment should go to 
which mine.

Shipments cannot be divided; each shipment must be sent to one 
mine or the other in its entirety. The two mines don't necessarily 
have to receive the same number of shipments (in fact, it is 
permitted to send all shipments to one mine).

Your program will be given the types of food shipments, in the 
order in which they are to be sent. Write a program that finds 
the largest total amount of coal that can be produced (in both 
mines) by deciding which shipments should be sent to mine 1 and 
which shipments should be sent to mine 2.

PROBLEM NAME: miners

INPUT FORMAT:

The first line of input contains an integer N (1 <= N <= 100,000), 
the number of food shipments. The second line contains a string 
consisting of N characters, the types of shipments in the order 
in which they are to be distributed. Each character will be one 
of the uppercase letters 'M' (for meat), 'F' (for fish) or 'B' 
(for bread).

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Output a single integer, the largest total amount of coal that can 
be produced.

SAMPLE INPUT 1:           SAMPLE OUTPUT 1:

6                         12

OUTPUT DETAILS:

By distributing the shipments in this order: mine 1, mine 1, mine 2, mine 2, mine 1, mine 2,
the shipments will result in 1, 2, 1, 2, 3 and 3 units of coal produced in that order, for a total of 12 units. There
are other ways to achieve this largest amount.

SAMPLE INPUT 2:           SAMPLE OUTPUT 2:

16                        29

A Game
======

Consider the following two-player game played with a sequence of 
N positive integers (2 <= N <= 100) laid onto a game board. 
Player 1 starts the game. The players move alternately by 
selecting a number from either the left or the right end of the 
sequence. That number is then deleted from the board, and its 
value is added to the score of the player who selected it. A 
player wins if his sum is greater than his opponents.

Write a program that implements the optimal strategy. The 
optimal strategy yields maximum points when playing against the 
"best possible" opponent. Your program must further implement 
an optimal strategy for player 2.

PROGRAM NAME: game1

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: N, the size of the board

* Line 2-etc: N integers in the range (1..200) that are the 
  contents of the game board, from left to right

SAMPLE INPUT:

6
4 7 2 9
5 2

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Two space-separated integers on a line: the score of Player 1 
followed by the score of Player 2.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

18 11

Face The Right Way
==================

Farmer John has arranged his N (1 <= N <= 5,000) cows in a row and
many of them are facing forward, like good cows, Some of them are
facing backward, though, and he needs them all to face forward to
make his life perfect.

Fortunately, FJ recently bought an automatic cow turning machine.
Since he purchased the discount model, it must be irrevocably preset
to turn K (1 <= K <= N) cows at once, and it can only turn cows
that are all standing next to each other in line. Each time the
machine is used, it reverses the facing direction of a contiguous
group of K cows in the line (one cannot use it on fewer than K cows,
e.g., at the either end of the line of cows). Each cow remains in
the same *location* as before, but ends up facing the *opposite
direction*.  A cow that starts out facing forward will be turned
backward by the machine and vice-versa.

Because FJ must pick a single, never-changing value of K, please
help him determine the minimum value of K that minimizes the number of
operations required by the machine to make all the cows face forward.
Also determine M, the minimum number of machine operations required
to get all the cows facing forward using that value of K.

PROBLEM NAME: cowturn

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single integer: N

* Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 contains a single character, F or B,
       indicating whether cow i is facing forward or backward.

SAMPLE INPUT:
7
B

F

F
B
B

INPUT DETAILS:

There are seven cows and they are facing backward, backward, forward,
backward, forward, backward, and backward, respectively.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: K and M

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

3 3

OUTPUT DETAILS:

For K = 3, the machine must be operated three times: turn cows 
(1,2,3), (3,4,5), and finally (5,6,7):

     B > F   F   F
     B > F   F   F
     F > B > F   F
     B   B > F   F
     F   F > B > F
     B   B   B > F
     B   B   B > F

Cow Patterns
============

A particular subgroup of K (1 <= K <= 25,000) of Farmer John's cows
likes to make trouble. When placed in a line, these troublemakers
stand together in a particular order. In order to locate these
troublemakers, FJ has lined up his N (1 <= N <= 100,000) cows. The
cows will file past FJ into the barn, staying in order. FJ needs
your help to locate suspicious blocks of K cows within this line
that might potentially be the troublemaking cows.

FJ distinguishes his cows by the number of spots 1..S on each cow's
coat (1 <= S <= 25). While not a perfect method, it serves his
purposes. FJ does not remember the exact number of spots on each
cow in the subgroup of troublemakers. He can, however, remember
which cows in the group have the same number of spots, and which
of any pair of cows has more spots (if the spot counts differ). He
describes such a pattern with a sequence of K ranks in the range
1..S.  For example, consider this sequence:

      1 4 4 3 2 1

In this example, FJ is seeking a consecutive sequence of 6 cows
from among his N cows in a line. Cows #1 and #6 in this sequence
have the same number of spots (although this number is not necessarily
1) and they have the smallest number of spots of cows #1..#6 (since
they are labeled as '1').  Cow #5 has the second-smallest number
of spots, different from all the other cows #1..#6.  Cows #2 and
#3 have the same number of spots, and this number is the largest
of all cows #1..#6.

If the true count of spots for some sequence of cows is:

 5 6 2 10 10 7 3 2 9

then only the subsequence 2 10 10 7 3 2 matches FJ's pattern above.

Please help FJ locate all the length-K subsequences in his line of
cows that match his specified pattern.

PROBLEM NAME: cpattern

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Three space-separated integers: N, K, and S

* Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 describes the number of spots on cow i.

* Lines N+2..N+K+1: Line i+N+1 describes pattern-rank slot i.

SAMPLE INPUT:

INPUT DETAILS:

The sample input corresponds to the example given in the problem statement.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The number of indices, B, at which the pattern matches

* Lines 2..B+1: An index (in the range 1..N) of the starting location
        where the pattern matches. The locations has to be in sorted increasing order.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

1
3

OUTPUT DETAILS:

There is only one match, at position 3 within FJ's sequence of N cows.

Trapezoid
=========

Consider two arbitrarily chosen horizontal lines. A trapezoid 
T_i between these lines has two vertices situated on the upper 
line and the other two vertices on the lower line (see figure 
below). We will denote by a_i, b_i, c_i and d_i the upper left, 
upper right, lower left and respectively lower right vertices 
of the trapezoid T_i. A subset S of trapezoids is called 
independent if no two trapezoids from S intersect.

Determine the cardinality of the largest independent set of 
trapezoids (the largest set means the set with most elements). 
Also find the count of different independent sets with maximum 
cardinality. Find this count modulo 30013.

PROBLEM NAME: trapezoid

INPUT FORMAT: 

The first line of input contains one integer N (1 <= N <= 100,000) 
- the number of trapezoids. Each of the next N lines contains 
four integers a_i, b_i, c_i and d_i (1 <= a_i, b_i, c_i, d_i <= 
1,000,000,000). No two trapezoids have a common vertex (corner).

OUTPUT FORMAT:

The only line of output should contain two numbers separated by 
space: firstly, the cardinality of the largest independent set; 
secondly, the count of different independent sets with maximum 
cardinality modulo 30013. 40% of the tests will have N <= 5000.
